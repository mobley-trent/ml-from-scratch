    "Linear regression is a statistical technique that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a widely used method for analyzing data and making predictions. Some general use cases for linear regression include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Forecasting time series data*: Linear regression can be used to model and forecast time series data, such as stock prices, weather patterns, and demand for goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Evaluating the impact of changes*: By training a linear regression model on data from before and after a change, such as the introduction of a new policy or the launch of a new product, it is possible to evaluate the impact of that change on some outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Testing hypotheses*: Linear regression can be used to test hypotheses about the relationship between different variables. For example, a researcher might use linear regression to test whether there is a relationship between income and happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Inferring causality*: In some cases, linear regression can be used to infer causality between two variables. For example, if a linear regression model shows that increasing the amount of exercise is associated with lower blood pressure, it is possible to infer that exercise causes a decrease in blood pressure. However, it is important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, linear regression is a versatile and widely used method for analyzing and making predictions based on data. It is often used as a starting point for more complex modeling and analysis, and it can provide valuable insights into the relationships between different variables in a dataset."
